# NNStreamer Examples

This repository shows developers how to create their applications with nnstreamer/gstreamer. We recommend to install nnstreamer by downloading prebuilt binary packages from Launchpad/PPA (Ubuntu) or Download.Tizen.org (Tizen). If you want to build nnstreamer in your system for your example application builds, pdebuild (Ubuntu) with PPA or gbs (Tizen) are recommended for building nnstreamer. This repository has been detached from nnstreamer.git to build examples independently from the nnstreamer souce code since Jan-09-2019.
