# NNStreamer Examples

This repository shows developers how to create their applications using nnstreamer/gstreamer. We recommend that you try to install nnstreamer package with Tizen/gbs command (or Ubuntu/pdebuild) in order to develop nnstreamer applications without compiling nnstreamer soruce code directly. This repository has been detached from nnstreamer.git to be built independently from the nnstreamer souce code since Jan-09-2019.

We provides example applications based on nnstreamer as following:

- Traditional Linux native applications
   - Linux/Ubuntu: GTK+ application
   - gst-launch-1.0 based scripts
- Tizen GUI Application
   - Tizen C/C++ application
   - Tizen .NET (C#) application
   - Tizen Web application
- Android applications
   - NDK based C/C++ CLI applicaton
   - JNI based GUI application
