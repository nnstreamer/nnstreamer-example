# Android NNStreamer Application Guide

We provide 2 types of Guides for Android NNStreamer. The one is Android Studio Guide and the other is Android Platform Guide.

* __Android App Guide using Studio__: If you simply make an Android NNStreamer Application using pre-built `aar` file, then refer to [this guide](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer-example/tree/master/android/example_app/README.md).
This guide is suitable for normal application developers.

* __Android Platform Guide__: If you are going to build Android rootFS from scratch for NNStreamer, then refer to [this guide](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer-example/tree/master/android/android_platform_guide.md).
This guide is _only_ suitable for Android platform developers or system guys.
